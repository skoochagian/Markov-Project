# Markov-Project

This repository holds my technical paper and associated MATLAB code for my Markov Chain project of the Game of Risk. This project was for a writing intensive course about mathematical technical writing at Christopher Newport University.

# Background

The focal point of this project was the concept of going to war. When two opponents go to war in the game, there is one person that is the attack and one person that is the defense. Each side send in a total number of armies, and have the choice of how many armies they can send in at a time to fight the other side. The scope of this project was to evaluate the defense and how many armies the defense should send in based on how many total number of armies the attack uses and how many armies they send in for each round of fighting. The attack was consistent of sending in 50 total armies, and the defense either sent in 50 or 25 armies. Through simulated figths with different number of armies sent out which determined the best strategy for the defense. More background information can be found in the research paper.

# Content

The content in this repository are as follows:
- The Excel File of all possible dice combinations for each different scenario of how many armies each side sends in. Each tab in the file signifies how many armies the defense sends and how many armies the attack sends
- The code used to create the game simulations. Each code is used for a different type of scenario
  - The code for a safe scenario, which is defined as the defense sending out 25 armies.
  - The code for a risky scenario, which is defined as the defense sending out 50 armies.
- The research paper that was turned in for the final assignment. This paper has the analysis of the simulated games and what the best strategy is.
